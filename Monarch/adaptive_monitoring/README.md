# adaptive-polling
This folder contains an adaptive polling heuristic designed for use with the Monarch network slice monitoring architecture. The adaptive polling technique dynamically adjusts the polling intervals based on network conditions, aiming to optimize the monitoring process in 5G networks.

## dataset
The dataset located in the [data](data) folder includes KPIs collected using Monarch by replaying a [real-world 5G dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/5g-traffic-datasets)  through our testbed. This dataset was used to test and validate the adaptive polling heuristic.
